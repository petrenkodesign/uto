## Overview

Our project is a network of microsatellites on balloons, providing stable communication through LoRa technology, known for its low power consumption and long range.

This system ensures efficient data transmission between air and ground devices, such as drones, ground stations, and decision-making centers, even in remote regions without traditional communication infrastructure. This allows for reliable and uninterrupted communication in hard-to-reach areas.

### Key Features

- **Controlled Balloons:** Equipped with two types of engines and guided by a control and positioning system powered by AI predictions.
- **Efficient Communication:** Stable data relay between devices in the air and on the ground.
- **Multi-Use Cases:**
  - Border protection and defense
  - Early detection and prevention of intrusions by unmanned systems
  - Establishing communication in combat zones
  - Ensuring safety for drone pilots and service personnel
  - Environmental monitoring
  - Coordination during natural disasters
  - Early warning of natural disasters
  - Climate change studies

## Interaction with SSA (Space Situational Awareness)

1. **Auxiliary Low-Orbit Monitoring:**  
   Balloons equipped with radar, optical sensors, or other systems enhance geographical coverage by observing objects in low orbit.

2. **Communication Relay:**  
   In remote areas like oceans or deserts, balloons act as data relays between SSA objects and control centers.

3. **Atmospheric Impact Assessment:**  
   Data from balloons improve atmospheric models, aiding in predictions for object reentry.

## Interaction with Copernicus

1. **Localized Observation:**  
   Balloons provide detailed monitoring at lower altitudes, complementing satellite data:
   - Air pollution monitoring
   - Soil and moisture analysis
   - Glacier condition studies

2. **Natural Phenomena Monitoring:**  
   Quick deployment of sensors for immediate data collection during natural disasters like fires or floods.

3. **Filling Data Gaps:**  
   Balloons serve as additional mobile platforms in areas where satellite resolution is limited or hindered by clouds.

### Synergy Between Systems

- **Threat Analysis:** Combining SSA space debris data with atmospheric models improves impact zone predictions.
- **Network Integration:** Balloons transmit real-time data to ground stations and complement Copernicus satellite imagery for quicker decision-making.
